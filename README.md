# Flappy Bird with Computer Vision

## Description

This is my attempt to create a bot that will open and play Flappy Bird using computer vision and AI.

## Usage

This project requires the dll output of my [IanAutomation project](https://github.com/Moses-Ian/IanAutomation)

## Link

View the deployed game here:

https://moses-ian.github.io/FlappyBirdWithComputerVision/

Stay tuned for when I create and post the bot.

## Credits

I'll clean up these links later.
